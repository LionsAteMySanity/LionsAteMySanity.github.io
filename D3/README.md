# D3

# Requirements
My game consists of three separate levels, broken with a summary screen once the player inevitably fails. Gameplay consists of controlling a ball on ice and dodging smaller orbs trying to kill you. Starting in the second level, there are two balls you must control at once. I believe I have satisfied the requirements of 3 Physics based scenes, given the motions of the balls, and the summary screens in between

# Asset Creation
All assets were created by me in Pixilart, and are wholly original. I went with pretty simple shapes in pixel art mostly because I'm not a great artist
